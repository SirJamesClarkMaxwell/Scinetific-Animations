# Scientific Animations Repository

Welcome to the **Scientific Animations** repository! This project is dedicated to creating visually stunning and scientifically accurate animations using the Manim library. Our goal is to make complex scientific concepts more accessible and engaging through high-quality visualizations.

## About

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for generating animations that explain various scientific phenomena. The animations are created using the [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git) library, a powerful tool for mathematical and scientific visualization. The repository is structured to support modular development and collaboration across different topics and custom objects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **Main Branch**: Contains only the final code for all animations.
-   **Topic-Specific Branches**: Each topic has a separate directory and branch where the code is stored. Current topics include:
    -   `Basic-Physics`
    -   `Semiconductor-Physics`
    -   `Semiconductor-Devices-Physics`
-   **Custom Objects Package**: A dedicated branch for storing custom objects. This branch is continuously developed and merged into specific animation branches as needed.

This structure ensures modularity and allows for focused development on individual topics while maintaining a clean and organized main branch.

## Getting Started

1. Create virtual environment (I recommend uv)
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scientific-Animations.git
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the example scripts to generate animations:
    ```bash
    python carrier_concentration_v2.py
    ```
